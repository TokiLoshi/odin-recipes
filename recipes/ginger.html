      <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>Pickled ginger is called gari or amazu shoga in Japanese. It's served with sushi or sashimi and helps enhance the flavors and clear your taste buds. It's also great with Century Eggs, a Chinese delicacy. You can find prepared pickled ginger in pink or white at most Asian markets but I prefer to make my own and share with family and friends.</p>
      <p>This dish takes 40 minutes to prepare, 5 minutes to cook, serves 32 and yields 1/2 cups of pickled ginger. It contains only 14 calories, 0 grams of fat, 3 grams of carbs and 0 grams of protein.</p>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>8 ounces fresh young ginger root, peeled</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons sea salt</li>
        <li>1 cup rice vinegar</li>
        <li>⅓ cup white sugar</li>
      </ul>
       <ol>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <li>Cut ginger into chunks. Place in a bowl, sprinkle with sea salt, and stir to coat. Let stand for about 30 minutes, then transfer to a clean lidded jar.</li>
        <li>Stir together rice vinegar and sugar in a saucepan until sugar has dissolved. Bring to a boil, then pour the boiling liquid over ginger root pieces in the jar.</li>
        <li>Allow the mixture to cool, then seal the jar. After a few minutes, the liquid may change to a slightly pinkish color; don't be alarmed. Store in the refrigerator for at least 1 week.</li>
        <li>Cut pieces of ginger into paper-thin slices for serving.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <p>As mentioned in the recipe, you may notice your liquid and/or ginger taking on a slightly pinkish color. This is caused by a reaction between the ginger and the rice wine vinegar and is nothing to be alarmed by. Some commercial pickled ginger has red coloring added to get the same familiar pink look. For safety when canning and preserving foods, contact your local extension for guidelines in your area that will be specific to your altitude.</p>
